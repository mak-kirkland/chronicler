# üìù Writing Pages in Markdown

Chronicler saves your worldbuilding notes as simple, human-readable **Markdown files**.

You can optionally add **YAML frontmatter** to include metadata like titles, tags, and images.

Chronicler also supports `[[wikilinks]]` for easy linking between pages ‚Äî just like in a wiki.

## üìÑ File Format

Each page is a Markdown `.md` file. You can optionally begin the file with a YAML frontmatter block like this:

```markdown
---
title: Rivertown
tags: [city, river, trade hub]
image: rivertown.jpg
---

# Rivertown

**Rivertown** is a vibrant settlement along the [[Silverflow River]].

## Economy

The town thrives on river trade and fishing exports from [[Silverflow River|Silverflow]].
```

## üß† Frontmatter Fields

All frontmatter is optional ‚Äî use it if it's helpful for you! Chronicler won't enforce any structure, so you're free to customize as much as you like.

However, three fields have special behavior:

| Field   | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `title` | The display title for the page. If omitted, the filename is used. |
| `tags`  | A list of tags to categorize the page. |
| `image` | The filename of an image (e.g., `rivertown.jpg`) used in the infobox. |

### Notes:
- You can define whatever fields you like, and as many as you like.
- Tags can also be anything you choose.
- Images must be placed in an `images/` folder inside your vault root.
  For example, if your vault is at `C:\Users\Frank\World`, your image should go in `C:\Users\Frank\World\images\`.
- Use `[[Page Name]]` to link to another page. If the page doesn‚Äôt exist yet, Chronicler will create a placeholder for it.
