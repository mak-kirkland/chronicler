<!--
  If `$activeModal` is not null, it means a modal has been requested.
  We then use Svelte's special `<svelte:component>` tag to dynamically render
  the component specified in the store.

  - `this={$activeModal.component}`: Tells Svelte *which* component to render.
  - `{...$activeModal.props}`: Spreads all the properties from the store's `props`
    object and passes them down to the rendered component.

  This manager acts as a dynamic renderer inside a wrapper. The specific modal
  (e.g., `RenameModal`) is rendered *inside* this `ModalManager` component.
