# Chronicler Privacy Policy
**Last Updated: January 2026**

Your privacy is paramount. Chronicler is designed so that your creative work stays on your machine. This policy explains what limited data is transmitted when you use the app.

## 1. Personal Data
We do not collect "Personally Identifiable Information" (PII) such as your name, address, or phone number in the current free version of the Software.

## 2. Anonymous Usage Analytics
To help improve the Software and understand installation success across different operating systems, Chronicler sends a basic technical "heartbeat" to our server. 
* **The Identifier:** We generate a unique ID for your installation. 
* **Privacy Protection:** This ID is salted and hashed locally on your machine before it is sent. It cannot be used to identify you or your device personally.
* **What is tracked:** Only basic technical events (e.g., "App Started," "Operating System Version"). We NEVER see your wiki content, notes, or images.

## 3. Data Storage
All your worldbuilding data (the "Vault") is stored locally on your hard drive. We do not have access to your files, and we do not host your data on our servers. You are responsible for your own backups.

## 4. Your Rights (GDPR)
Although the data we collect is anonymized, we provide the following protections:
* **Right to Opt-Out:** You may request to opt-out of anonymous analytics at any time.
* **Data Transparency:** We will never sell or share your technical data with third-party advertisers.

## 5. Future Purchases
If we offer paid features in the future, we will use a third-party payment processor. At that time, this policy will be updated to explain how your email address is used for license management and support.

## 6. Contact
If you have questions about this policy, please contact us via our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cXJwcbe2b7) community or at michael@chronicler.pro.
