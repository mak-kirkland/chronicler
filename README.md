# 📘 Chronicler – A Markdown-Based Offline Worldbuilding App

**Chronicler** is a free, open-source, standalone desktop application for fantasy worldbuilders, especially Game Masters and authors. It’s designed for full **offline use**, ensuring that **you own your data** — all files are saved locally in a standard, human-readable Markdown format using a clear folder hierarchy.

## ✨ Features (Planned & In Progress)

### 📂 File Structure & Markdown Rendering
- Organizes your world with simple **folders and Markdown files**, like Obsidian

### 🔖 Tagging & Linking
- Frontmatter-based **tags** with support for **tag hierarchies**
- Internal **[[wikilinks]]** with autocomplete
- **Backlinks** to quickly see where a page is referenced
- **Automatic indexing**: tag pages update themselves when tags are added/removed

### 🧠 Infoboxes & Templates
- Built-in support for structured data via **infoboxes** (e.g., for characters, items, locations)
- Easily define your own templates

### 🌐 Navigable Hierarchies
- Support for **multiple categorization paths** (e.g., `Characters/NPCs/Orelia` and `Factions/Eldritch Knights/Orelia`)
- Works via smart indexing, giving multiple access paths to the same file

### 🖼️ Media Support
- Image embedding via `![[images/filename.jpg]]`, stored locally under `images/`
- Drag-and-drop support for attaching media

### 🔐 Offline and Private
- 100% offline. No cloud, no lock-in.
- Files are Markdown + YAML — readable and portable forever.

# 🪙 Patreon Pitch: Support *Chronicler*

## 🧙‍♂️ Chronicler: A Worldbuilding App Built by Worldbuilders

Imagine a worldbuilding tool that doesn't tell you how to create. It just helps you **organize** and **explore** the world you imagine — offline, markdown-based, 100% yours.

**Chronicler** is a labor of love — an open-source app for worldbuilders and GMs who want:

- Zero subscription fees  
- Zero cloud dependency  
- Full ownership of your files and creative vision

I'm building Chronicler to give creators a tool that grows with your world, not one that walls you in behind a subscription.
