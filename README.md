**Chronicler is a free, offline worldbuilding tool and local wiki for writers, game masters, and tabletop RPG creators.** It saves your notes as plain Markdown files on your computer. No sign-up, no subscription, no cloud. Your world stays on your device.

Unlike cloud-based tools like World Anvil, Notion, or Campfire, Chronicler runs 100% offline and stores everything locally. You own your files forever. No internet required, no vendor lock-in, no monthly fees.

## 🧭 Philosophy

> Your notes. Your files. Your rules.

Chronicler is built on three principles:

- **Ownership**: Your data is stored in plain-text Markdown on your machine. Not in a proprietary database. Not on someone else's server. You can read your files with any text editor, forever.
- **Privacy**: The app works 100% offline. No accounts, no analytics, no telemetry. What you write is yours alone.
- **Simplicity**: Powerful tools for linking ideas, without the setup headache. Chronicler works out of the box with zero configuration.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Download the latest release** from the [Releases Page](https://github.com/mak-kirkland/chronicler/releases/latest) for Windows, macOS, or Linux.

   > #### ⚠️ Windows Users
   >
   > Microsoft Defender may show a "Windows protected your PC" screen. This is normal for new unsigned applications from independent developers.
   > Click **"More info"** then **"Run anyway"**. The application is safe, and you can verify the source code here on GitHub.

   > #### 🍎 macOS Users
   >
   > Chronicler for macOS is currently unsigned. To open it:
   > 1. Download the `.dmg` and move the app to **Applications**.
   > 2. Open **Terminal** and run:
   >    ```sh
   >    sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /Applications/chronicler.app
   >    ```
   > 3. The app will now open correctly.

   > #### 🛡️ Security & Trust
   >
   > While the installer is unsigned, all in-app updates are **cryptographically signed** using [Tauri's built-in updater](https://tauri.app/plugin/updater), ensuring every update is authentic and untampered.

2. **Create a Vault**: Pick a folder on your computer where Chronicler will store your notes.

3. **📘 [Read the Help Guide](HELP.md)**: Learn Markdown, wikilinks, infoboxes, and organization.
