## [v0.4.0-alpha] - 2025-07-22

### ‚ú® Added

- **Editor**: The editor has been replaced with CodeMirror 6, which enables link and tag autocompletions.

### üêû Fixed

- **Drag and Drop**: Disabled the operating system's native drag-and-drop to ensure the HTML5 drag-and-drop feature works correctly on Windows and MacOS.
- **Internal**: Updated Tauri and its dependencies, fixing a bug that prevented the changelog from being displayed in the update modal.

### üîÑ Changed

- **Internal**: Reduced log pollution by no longer logging full page content for the `write_page_content` trace, as the path is sufficient.

---

## [v0.3.2-alpha] - 2025-07-21

### ‚ú® Added

- **Welcome Page**: Added a link to join the community on Discord in the welcome screen's footer.

### üêû Fixed

---

## [v0.3.1-alpha] - 2025-07-21

### üîÑ Changed

- **File Watcher**: The file watcher is now more comprehensive. It correctly interprets a "Move to Trash" operation as a deletion and handles the creation and deletion of entire folders more intelligently, ensuring the file index remains consistent.
- **Stability**: The core locking strategy for file operations was refactored to use top-level write locks, preventing potential deadlocks and race conditions under heavy use.
- **Internal**: The application's code structure was improved for better maintainability, which will speed up future development.

## [v0.3.0-alpha] - 2025-07-19

### ‚ú® Added

- **Updater**: The update notification modal now displays a formatted changelog with notes on the latest version.
- **Explorer**: File explorer search has been improved; directories now dynamically expand to show matching files, and the manual expansion state is remembered after a search is complete.
- **Sidebar**: The search term in the sidebar is now automatically cleared when switching between the "Files" and "Tags" tabs.

### üîÑ Changed

- **Internal**: All application capabilities have been refactored into a default.json file.

---

## [v0.2.0-alpha] - 2025-07-19

### ‚ú® Added

**Improved Drag-and-Drop Experience**:

- **Root Drop Zone**: A dedicated drop zone now appears at the top of the file explorer when dragging, allowing files and folders to be moved to the vault root in a clear and predictable way.
- **Auto-Scrolling**: The file explorer now automatically scrolls when you drag an item near the top or bottom edge, making it easy to drop files into folders that are currently out of view.

### üîÑ Changed

- **Refactored Drag-and-Drop Logic**: The internal code for drag-and-drop was refactored into reusable Svelte DOM actions (draggable and droppable), simplifying component logic and improving maintainability.

---

## [v0.1.10-alpha] - 2025-07-18

### ‚ú® Added

- **Drag-and-Drop support**: Enabled drag-and-drop functionality in the File Explorer, allowing you to move files and folders to new locations directly within the app.

---

## [v0.1.9-alpha] - 2025-07-17

### ‚ú® Added

- **Quick-Create Buttons**: Added hover-activated buttons to each directory in the file explorer, allowing for the quick creation of new pages and folders directly within that directory.

### üîÑ Changed

- **Improved Styling**: Further unified CSS styling by centralizing more colors and typography into global variables.

### üêû Fixed

- **Editor Reverted**: Temporarily reverted the editor from CodeMirror 6 back to a standard textarea. This was done to resolve critical bugs in the production build. The advanced editor with autocompletion will be re-introduced once the build issues are fully solved.
- **Build Stability**: Corrected the SvelteKit configuration to properly build for SPA (Single-Page Application) mode, which is essential for Tauri apps.

---

### ‚ú® Added

- **Editor Autocompletion**: The editor has been upgraded to CodeMirror 6 and now provides autocompletion suggestions for [[wikilinks]] and frontmatter tags: [].

### üîÑ Changed

- **UI & Branding**: The application logo has been added to the welcome screen and vault selector for a more consistent brand identity.

### üêû Fixed

- **Frontmatter Rendering**: Fixed a bug where having duplicate keys in a page's frontmatter would prevent the page from rendering correctly.

## [v0.1.7-alpha] - 2025-07-13

### ‚ú® Added

- **Automatic Link Updating**: When you rename a file from within Chronicler, all wikilinks pointing to that file in your vault will now be updated automatically.

## [v0.1.3-alpha] - 2025-07-09

### üêû Fixed

- **Accessibility Controls**: Added keyboard controls and improved focus management for modals, previews, and the resizable sidebar.

### üîÑ Changed

- **Centralized State Management**: Major refactor of the frontend state. A single `worldStore` now acts as the source of truth for files and tags, with other parts of the UI subscribing to it.
- **Abstracted Backend Commands**: All calls to the Rust backend were moved into a dedicated `commands.ts` file, creating a clean API layer for the frontend.
- **Bundled Fonts Locally**: Fonts are now included in the application binary instead of being fetched from the web, preventing a "flash of unstyled content" on startup.
- **Backend-driven Filename Sanitization**: The Rust backend is now solely responsible for removing the `.md` extension from filenames, simplifying frontend logic.

- **Backend Markdown Rendering**: A dedicated rendering engine was included to process Markdown and wikilinks into HTML on the backend.
- **Configurable Vault Path**: Added a settings dialog to allow users to select and change their vault directory.
- **File Explorer**: A file tree is displayed in the left sidebar to navigate the vault and open files.
- **File View**: Markdown editor and preview to change the content of a file and see the rendered output.
