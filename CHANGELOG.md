## [v0.1.4-alpha] - 2025-07-10

### ‚ú® Added

- **Help Page**:  Added a button that opens a help page with instructions on writing Markdown and YAML frontmatter. It explains how to format content, use tags, and create links between pages.

### üîÑ Changed

- **Infobox Location**: Moved the infobox into the Preview component. This simplifies the FileView and ensures the infobox scrolls naturally with the rest of the page.

### üêû Fixed

- **Malformed YAML**: Fixed an issue where invalid YAML frontmatter would cause the entire page to fail rendering.

## [v0.1.3-alpha] - 2025-07-09

### ‚ú® Added

- **Infobox Images**: The infobox can now display the image defined by the YAML frontmatter.

### üîÑ Changed

- **Dynamic Infobox Layout**: The infobox is now responsive and changes its position based on the context. It appears at the top of the page in split view and on the right-hand side in preview-only mode. The layout also adapts for screens narrower than 480px.
- **Simplified Tag Data**: Refactored tag data handling by updating the backend to return data in the desired format, and updating the frontend to consistently use the single unified tag store derived from the global world state.
- **Backlinks Sidebar**: The width of the backlinks sidebar has been reduced from 280px to 200px.
- **Editor Scrollbar**: The editor's scrollbar is now flush with the side of the window for a cleaner look.

## [v0.1.2-alpha] - 2025-07-08

### ‚ú® Added

- **Context Menus**: Right-click context menus have been added to the file tree, providing actions to create, rename, and delete files and folders.
- **Timestamp Display**: The user interface now displays the last modified timestamp for the currently viewed page.
- **"New Folder" Button**: Added a button to create a new folder directly in the vault's root.

### üîÑ Changed

- **Improved New Page Workflow**: Creating a new page now automatically opens it and focuses the editor, allowing you to start typing immediately.
- **Centralized Modal Logic**: The modal system was refactored to use a central store and a generic `TextInputModal`, simplifying the code and improving maintainability.
- **Removed Tailwind CSS**: All styling is now handled with plain, scoped CSS for a simpler and more lightweight frontend.
- **Sidebar Configuration**: The initial width of the sidebar is now a configurable setting.

### üêû Fixed

- **Empty Directory Display**: Fixed a bug where empty directories were not being displayed correctly in the file tree.

## [v0.1.1-alpha] - 2025-07-05

### ‚ú® Added

- **Importer for .docx Files**: Added the ability to import Microsoft Word documents, which are automatically converted to Markdown while preserving formatting.
- **Automatic Pandoc Installation**: The application can now check for and download the correct version of Pandoc on-demand to power the import functionality.
- **Accessibility Controls**: Added keyboard controls and improved focus management for modals, previews, and the resizable sidebar.

### üîÑ Changed

- **Centralized State Management**: Major refactor of the frontend state. A single `worldStore` now acts as the source of truth for files and tags, with other parts of the UI subscribing to it.
- **Abstracted Backend Commands**: All calls to the Rust backend were moved into a dedicated `commands.ts` file, creating a clean API layer for the frontend.
- **Bundled Fonts Locally**: Fonts are now included in the application binary instead of being fetched from the web, preventing a "flash of unstyled content" on startup.
- **Backend-driven Filename Sanitization**: The Rust backend is now solely responsible for removing the `.md` extension from filenames, simplifying frontend logic.

## [v0.1.0-alpha] - 2025-07-04

### ‚ú® Added

- **Initial Project Setup**: The Chronicler application was born! This initial version includes a Rust backend powered by Tauri 2.0 and a Svelte 5 frontend.
- **Full File System Indexing**: The application performs a full scan of the vault on startup, building an in-memory index of all pages, tags, and links.
- **Real-time File Watching**: The application watches the vault for file changes (creations, modifications, deletions, and renames) and updates the UI in real-time.
- **Backend Markdown Rendering**: A dedicated rendering engine was included to process Markdown and wikilinks into HTML on the backend.
- **Configurable Vault Path**: Added a settings dialog to allow users to select and change their vault directory.
- **File Explorer**: A file tree is displayed in the left sidebar to navigate the vault and open files.
- **File View**: Markdown editor and preview to change the content of a file and see the rendered output.
- **Backlinks and Tag Views**: Implemented a backlinks sidebar and a dedicated view to see all pages associated with a specific tag.
- **Search Functionality**: A search bar was added to the sidebar to filter both files and tags.
- **GitHub Actions Release Workflow**: A CI/CD pipeline was set up to automate the building and releasing of the application.
- **Custom Fonts and Styling**: The application was given its unique parchment and ink aesthetic with the "IM Fell English" and "Uncial Antiqua" fonts.
