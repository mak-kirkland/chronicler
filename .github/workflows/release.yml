                      ## Installation & Notes

                      - **üíª Windows**: Download the `.msi` file to install.
                      - **üêß Linux**: Download the `.AppImage` (for most distributions) or the `.deb` / `.rpm` file for your package manager.
                      - **üçé macOS**: Download the `aarch64.dmg` (Apple Silicon) or `x64.dmg` (Intel) file.

                      ---

                      ### ‚ö†Ô∏è A Note for Windows Users
                      When you first run the installer, Microsoft Defender may show a "Windows protected your PC" screen. This is expected because Chronicler is a new application from an independent developer and is not yet code-signed.

                      To proceed, simply click **"More info"** and then **"Run anyway"**.

                      ### üçé A Note for macOS Users
                      Chronicler for macOS is currently **unsigned**. The first time you open it, you will need to run a command in the Terminal.

                      1.  **Download** the `.dmg` file and move the app to your **Applications** folder.
                      2.  **Open the Terminal** app.
                      3.  **Run this command**:
                          ```sh
                          sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /Applications/chronicler.app
                          ```
                      4.  The app will now open correctly.

                      ### üõ°Ô∏è Security & Trust
                      While the initial installer is unsigned, all in-app updates are cryptographically signed by me. The built-in updater verifies this signature before installing any new version, ensuring that all future updates are authentic and have not been tampered with.

                  # Set to 'true' if you want to create a draft release instead of a published one.
                  releaseDraft: true
