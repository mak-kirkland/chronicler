# üß∞ Getting Started

Welcome to **Chronicler** ‚Äî your digital scriptorium for worldbuilding, notes, and knowledge management.

This guide is split into three parts. Start with **The Essentials** to learn the basics and get writing in minutes. When you're ready for more power, move on to the **Customization** and **Advanced Guide**.

---

# Part 1: The Essentials

## üìÅ Vaults and Files

Chronicler stores your notes as plain Markdown (`.md`) files in a folder on your computer, called a **vault**.

-   ‚úÖ You choose where your vault lives (e.g., `C:\Users\YourName\MyWorld`).
-   üìÇ Create folders and organize your files however you like.
-   üîÅ Changes made on your computer are instantly reflected in the app.

---

## üìù Writing in Markdown

Chronicler uses **Markdown** to format your pages.

- Use `# heading`, `## subheading`, `**bold**`, `*italic*`, `-` for bullet lists, and so on
- Use `---` to insert horizontal separators to divide long pages into readable sections.

---

## üîó Linking Between Pages

Use `[[Page Name]]` to link to other pages in your vault.

-   Create an alias with `[[Page Name|link text]]`.
-   When you rename a page, all links to it are automatically updated.
-   See all pages that link *to* your current page in the **Backlinks** panel.

---

## üîñ Infoboxes

At the top of each page is an **infobox** for at-a-glance details. This is controlled by a block of text at the very top of your file called **YAML frontmatter**. This is where you can set the page's title, add an image, and apply tags.

```yaml
---
title: Rivertown
image: rivertown.jpg
tags: [city, trade, river]
---
```

---

## üìÇ Organizing with Tags & Folders

There are two main ways to organize your vault:

1.  üóÇÔ∏è **Folders**: Create folders in the file explorer to group related pages, like `Places/`, `Characters/`, or `History/`.
2.  üè∑Ô∏è **Tags**: Add a list of tags to the `tags` field in the infobox. Click any tag to see all other pages with that tag.

```yaml
tags: [city, coastal]
```

Tip: Pages and folders are ordered alphabetically. If you want to enforce a specific order, you can prefix them with numbers (e.g., `01_Characters`, `02_Places`, `03_History`).

---

## üñºÔ∏è Images

You can store your images in any folder within your vault, e.g a central `images/` folder, or right next to your notes. Chronicler will find them automatically.

### Infobox Images

You can display an image in a page‚Äôs **infobox** by adding the `image` field to the frontmatter at the top of your file:

```yaml
image: rivertown.jpg
```

### Page Images

The easiest way to add an image to the body of your page is with the wikilink syntax:

```markdown
![[world-map.jpg]]
```

*For more control over image size and placement, see the Advanced Guide.*

---

## ü´£ Spoilers

Hide text by wrapping it in double pipes `||like this||`. The text will be blacked out until a reader clicks on it.

> The king‚Äôs advisor is ||secretly a vampire||.

---

## üóÑÔ∏è Tables

Create simple tables with pipes `|` and dashes `-`.

```markdown
| Item   | Price |
|--------|-------|
| Sword  | 100gp |
| Shield | 75gp  |
```

Tip: Links with custom text (e.g., `[[Page|Link text]]`) use the `|` symbol, which can break a table's structure. To fix this, just add a backslash `\` before it: `[[Page\|Link text]]`.

*For more control over tables, see the Advanced Guide.*

---

## üß© Page Inserts

Embed the content of one page directly inside another. This is great for reusing information (e.g navboxes, item cards, stat blocks...) so you only have to update it in one place.

```markdown
{{insert: Page Name}}
```

You can also set a custom title for the header, or make the insert start hidden.

```markdown
{{insert: The Great War | title="Summary of the Great War" | hidden}}
```

---

# Part 2: Customization

This section covers customization for your workflow and the appearance of your pages.

## Application Settings Directory
Chronicler stores global settings, themes, fonts, and templates in a dedicated folder on your computer. You can find it here:

-   **Windows**: `%AppData%\io.github.mak-kirkland.chronicler\`
-   **Linux**: `~/.local/share/io.github.mak-kirkland.chronicler/`
-   **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/io.github.mak-kirkland.chronicler/`

## üìÑ Page Templates

Use templates to create new pages with a pre-defined structure, saving you time and ensuring consistency across your vault. For example, you could have templates for characters, locations, or session notes, each with pre-defined YAML frontmatter and section headings.

-   **Manage Templates**: Go to **Settings ‚Üí Manage Templates** to create and edit them.
-   **Automatic Title**: Use the `{{title}}` placeholder in a template. It will be automatically replaced with the new page's name.

## üé® Themes & Fonts
-   **Themes**: Switch between built-in color schemes or create your own with the Theme Editor.
-   **Custom Fonts**: Add your own `.woff2`, `.ttf`, or `.otf` font files to the `fonts` subfolder within the **Application Settings Directory**. After a restart, they will be available in the theme editor.hemes

# üöÄ Part 3: Advanced Guide

This section covers powerful features for enhancing your workflow.

## üîñ Mastering the Infobox (YAML Frontmatter)

The "infobox" at the top of each page is controlled by a block of text called **YAML frontmatter**. You can add any custom fields you want (e.g., `population`, `leader`, `age`), and they will automatically appear in the infobox.

Several fields have special functionality:

| Field      | Description                                                 |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `title`    | The display title for the page and infobox.                 |
| `subtitle` | A subtitle shown in the infobox.                            |
| `infobox`  | A header shown below the infobox image.                     |
| `tags`     | A list of tags for organization.                            |
| `image`    | An image or carousel of images for the infobox.             |
| `layout`   | Rules for creating headers and columns in the infobox.      |

### üñºÔ∏è Image Carousels

Besides a single image, you can provide a list of images to create a carousel in the **infobox**:

```yaml
image: [rivertown_day.jpg, rivertown_night.jpg, rivertown_castle.jpg]
```

You can also add captions to each image in the carousel:

```
image: [[rivertown_day.jpg, "Day"], [rivertown_night.jpg, "Night"]]
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Special syntax inside frontmatter values

Some values may contain special characters that need to be treated properly (for example `[[wikilinks]]` or `||spoilers||`). There are two safe ways to include these without breaking the frontmatter:

1. **Wrap the value in quotes**:

```yaml
motto: 'Strength | Honor'
race: '[[Elf|High Elf]]'
```

2. **For multi-line text, or to use special characters without quotes, start the line with a pipe symbol (`|`)**

```yaml
notes: |
  This text can contain [[wikilinks]] or ||spoilers|| directly.
  It can also span multiple lines.
```

### ‚úçÔ∏è Inline Markdown in Field Values

You can use Markdown like `**bold**` and `*italic*` inside field values.

```yaml
motto: '*Strength and Honor*'
homepage: '[Official Site](https://example.com)'
```

### ‚öúÔ∏è Inline Images

You can embed small images like flags or icons directly into infobox fields. This is great for adding visual flair next to text.

```yaml
allegiance: 'Lynorian Empire ![[lynorian-flag.png]]'
```

### ü™Ñ Advanced Infobox Layouts

Use the `layout` key to add headers and group fields into columns for a professional, wiki-style infobox.

#### Adding Headers
-   `type: header`: Defines the rule as a header.
-   `text: 'Your Text'`: The text to display in the header.
-   `position: { above: 'field_name' }`: Injects the header immediately before `field_name`.

#### Grouping Fields into Columns
-   `type: group`: Defines the rule as a group.
-   `render_as: columns`: Specifies that the group should be rendered as columns.
-   `keys: [field1, field2]`: A list of the frontmatter keys to include in the group.

#### Full Example
```yaml
---
title: Battle of the Somme
belligerents_allies: ["United Kingdom", "France"]
belligerents_central: ["German Empire"]
commander_allies: ["Douglas Haig", "Ferdinand Foch"]
commander_central: ["Erich von Falkenhayn"]

layout:
  - type: header
    text: Belligerents
    position: { above: belligerents_allies }
  - type: group
    render_as: columns
    keys: [belligerents_allies, belligerents_central]
  - type: header
    text: Commanders
    position: { above: commander_allies }
  - type: group
    render_as: columns
    keys: [commander_allies, commander_central]
---
```

## üñºÔ∏è Advanced Images

### ‚ú® Images in the Page Body

For full control over an image's size, alignment, and caption, use HTML tags in the body of your page.

**Float an image to the right of your text:**
```html
<img
  src="rivertown-market.png"
  style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; width: 300px;"
>
```

**Add a caption using `<figure>`:**
```html
<figure style="float: right; width: 250px;">
  <img src="silverflow-river.jpg" style="width: 100%;">
  <figcaption style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">
    The Silverflow River at dawn.
  </figcaption>
</figure>
```

### ‚öúÔ∏è Inline Images (e.g., Flags or Icons)

You can also place small images directly into a line of text. This is perfect for icons or flags. The `height: 1em;` style makes the image scale with the text, and `vertical-align: middle;` centers it nicely.

```html
The Gooblboys invaded the Lynorian Empire <img src="lynorian-flag.png" alt="Lynorian Empire Flag" style="height: 1em; vertical-align: middle;"> on a Saturday.
```

---

## üóÑÔ∏è Advanced Tables

You can control the alignment of content within columns by adding colons (`:`) to the header separator line.

* A colon on the left side of the hyphens makes the content **left-aligned** (this is the default).
* A colon on the right side makes the content **right-aligned**.
* A colon on both sides makes the content **centered**.

Example:

```markdown
| Item | Price |
|---|---:|
| Sword | 100gp |
| Shield | 75gp |
```

You can also use **standard HTML `<table>` tags** to create more complex tables with greater styling control.

---

## ü™Ñ Advanced Layouts

Use floating layouts to place tables or images beside your text instead of above or below it.

Wrap your content in a `<div class="float-container">`, and add either `.float-left` or `.float-right` to the element you want to float.

```html
<div class="float-container">

  <table class="float-left">
    </table>

  <h3>Level 1</h3>
  To ease new players into the XP system...

</div>
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Markdown headers (`##`) won't wrap inside the container. Use HTML tags instead (`<h2>`).

---

## ‚úíÔ∏è Inline Styling

Use basic HTML tags directly in your Markdown to style specific pieces of text. This is useful for adding thematic fonts or colors. The `style` attribute is supported on `<p>` and `<span>` tags.

```html
<p style="font-family:'Your Custom Font'; color:blue; font-size:2rem">This paragraph will be big and blue.</p>
```

```html
This text is normal, but <span style="font-family:'Your Custom Font';">these words</span> are special.
```

## üì• Importing Word Docs

You can import `.docx` files from Microsoft Word directly into your vault.

- Go to **Settings ‚Üí Import from .docx** and choose your files
- Formatting (headings, bold, italics, links) is preserved
- Requires Pandoc (Chronicler can download it for you automatically)
